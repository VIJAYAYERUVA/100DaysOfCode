Aeschylus ,Agamemnon,1              ,Watchman              ,"       Release from this weary task of mine has been my plea to the gods throughout this long year's watch, in which, lying upon the palace roof of the Atreidae, upon my bent arm, like a dog, I have learned to know well the gathering of the night's stars, those radiant potentates conspicuous in the firmament, bringers of winter and summer to mankind [the constellations, when they rise and set]. So now I am still watching for the signal-flame, the gleaming fire that is to bring news from  Troy  and tidings of its capture.  For thus commands my queen, woman in passionate heart and man in strength of purpose.  And whenever I make here my bed, restless and dank with dew and unvisited by dreams—for instead of sleep fear stands ever by my side, so that I cannot close my eyelids fast in sleep—and whenever I care to sing or hum （and thus apply an antidote of song to ward off drowsiness）, then my tears start forth, as I bewail the fortunes of this house of ours, not ordered for the best as in days gone by. But tonight may there come a happy release from my weary task!  May the fire with its glad tidings flash through the gloom! stage  The signal fire suddenly flashes out Oh welcome, you blaze in the night, a light as if of day, you harbinger of many a choral dance in  Argos  in thanksgiving for this glad event!  Hallo! Hallo!  To Agamemnon's queen I thus cry aloud the signal to rise from her bed, and as quickly as she can to lift up in her palace halls a shout of joy in welcome of this fire, if the city of  Ilium  truly is taken, as this beacon unmistakably announces.  And I will make an overture with a dance upon my own account; for my lord's lucky roll I shall count to my own score, now that this beacon has thrown me triple six. Ah well, may the master of the house come home and may I clasp his welcome hand in mine!  For the rest I stay silent; a great ox stands upon my tongue —yet the house itself, could it but speak, might tell a plain enough tale; since, for my part, by my own choice I have words for those who know, and to those who do not know, I've lost my memory.stage  He descends by an inner stairway; attendants kindle fires at the altars placed in front of the palace.

Aeschylus ,Agamemnon,2              ,Chorus                ," This is now the tenth year since Priam's mighty adversary, king Menelaus, and with him king Agamemnon, the mighty pair of Atreus' sons, joined in honor of throne and sceptre by Zeus, set forth from this land with an army of a thousand ships manned by Argives, a warrior force to champion their cause. Loud rang the battle-cry they uttered in their rage, just as eagles scream which, in lonely grief for their brood, rowing with the oars of their wings, wheel high over their bed, because they have lost the toil of guarding their nurslings' nest.  But some one of the powers supreme—Apollo perhaps or Pan, or Zeus—hears the shrill wailing scream of the clamorous birds, these sojourners in his realm, and against the transgressors sends vengeance at last though late. Even so Zeus, whose power is over all, Zeus, lord of host and guest, sends against Alexander the sons of Atreus, that for the sake of a woman with many husbands he may inflict many and wearying struggles （when the knee is pressed in the dust and the spear is splintered in the onset） on Danaans and on Trojans alike. The case now stands where it stands—it moves to fulfilment at its destined end.  Not by offerings burned in secret, not by secret libations, not by tears, shall man soften the stubborn wrath of unsanctified sacrifices.  But we, incapable of service by reason of our aged frame, discarded from that martial mustering of long ago, wait here at home, supporting on our canes a strength like a child's.  For just as the vigor of youth, leaping up within the breast, is like that of old age, since the war-god is not in his place; so extreme age, its leaves already withering, goes its way on triple feet, and, no better than a child, wanders, a dream that is dreamed by day.  But, O daughter of Tyndareos, Queen Clytaemestra, what has happened?  What news do you have?  On what intelligence and convinced by what report do you send about your messengers to command sacrifice?  For all the gods our city worships, the gods supreme, the gods below, the gods of the heavens and of the marketplace, have their altars ablaze with offerings.  Now here, now there, the flames rise high as heaven, yielding to the soft and guileless persuasion of holy ointment, the sacrificial oil itself brought from the inner chambers of the palace.

Only may no jealous god-sent wrath cast its shadow upon the embattled host, the mighty bit forged for  Troy 's mouth, and strike it before it reaches its goal!

For there abides wrath— terrible, not to be suppressed, a treacherous guardian of the home, a wrath that never forgets and that exacts vengeance for a child.” Such utterances of doom, derived from auguries on the march, together with many blessings, did Calchas proclaim to the royal house; and in harmony with this, Sing the song of woe, the song of woe, but may the good prevail!"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,0.805   ,positive       ,positive      ,fear        ,Topic 4       ,0.5065000057220459 ,"[['god', 20.91], ['zeus', 15.33], ['like', 9.56], ['land', 8.45], ['cry', 8.26], ['mother', 7.79], ['lord', 7.79], ['earth', 7.68], ['woman', 7.19], ['come', 7.04]]"

Aeschylus ,Agamemnon,31             ,Clytaemestra          ,"Hephaestus, from Ida speeding forth his brilliant blaze.  Beacon passed beacon on to us by courier-flame: Ida, to the Hermaean crag in  Lemnos ; to the mighty blaze upon the island succeeded, third, the summit of  Athos  sacred to Zeus; and, soaring high aloft so as to leap across the sea, the flame, travelling joyously onward in its strength  the pinewood torch, its golden-beamed light, as another sun, passing the message on to the watchtowers of Macistus. He, delaying not nor carelessly overcome by sleep, did not neglect his part as messenger.  Far over Euripus' stream came the beacon-light and signalled to the watchmen on Messapion.  They, kindling a heap of withered heather, lit up their answering blaze and sped the message on.  The flame, now gathering strength and in no way dimmed, like a radiant moon overleaped the plain of Asopus to Cithaeron's ridges, and roused another relay of missive fire. Nor did the warders there disdain the far-flung light, but made a blaze higher than their commands. Across Gorgopus' water shot the light, reached the mount of Aegiplanctus, and urged the ordinance of fire to make no delay. Kindling high with unstinted force a mighty beard of flame, they sped it forward so that, as it blazed, it passed even the headland that looks upon the Saronic gulf; until it swooped down when it reached the lookout, near to our city, upon the peak of Arachnaeus; and next upon this roof of the Atreidae it leapt, this very fire not undescended from the Idaean flame. Such are the torch-bearers I have arranged, completing the course in succession one to the other; and the victor is he who ran both first and last.

Aeschylus ,Agamemnon,33             ,Clytaemestra          ," This day the Achaeans hold  Troy . Within the town there sounds loud, I believe, a clamor of voices which will not blend.  Pour vinegar and oil into the same vessel and you will say that, as foes, they keep apart; so the cries of vanquished and victors greet the ear, distinct as their fortunes are diverse.  Those, flung upon the corpses of their husbands and their brothers, children upon the bodies of their aged fathers who gave them life, bewail from lips no longer free the death of their dearest ones, while these— a night of restless toil after battle sets them down famished to break their fast on such fare as the town affords; not faring according to rank, but as each man has drawn his lot by chance. And even now they are quartered in the captured Trojan homes, delivered from the frosts and dew of the naked sky, and like happy men will sleep all the night without a guard. Now if they keep clear of guilt towards the gods of the town—those of the conquered land—and towards their shrines, the captors shall not be made captives in their turn.  Only may no mad impulse first assail the army, overmastered by greed, to pillage what they should not!  For to win safe passage home they need to travel back the other length of their double course. But even if, without having offended the gods, our troops should reach home, the grievous suffering of the dead might still remain awake—if no fresh disaster transpires.  These are my woman's words; but may the good prevail clearly for all to see!

And such was Paris, who came to the house of the sons of Atreus and dishonoured the hospitality of his host by stealing away a wedded wife."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   ,-0.9578 ,negative       ,negative      ,anger       ,Topic 6       ,0.5016999840736389 ,"[['may', 13.25], ['god', 12.32], ['son', 10.52], ['one', 10.25], ['man', 10.09], ['come', 9.71], ['father', 9.03], ['men', 8.57], ['must', 8.4], ['land', 7.85]]"

Too credulous, a woman's mind has boundaries open to quick encroachment; but quick to perish is rumor spread by a woman."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,0.4985  ,positive       ,negative      ,fear        ,Topic 3       ,0.4426000118255615 ,"[['shall', 23.19], ['yet', 11.63], ['thy', 10.99], ['must', 10.91], ['thou', 7.42], ['men', 7.32], ['thee', 7.29], ['greek', 7.18], ['come', 7.04], ['pain', 7.03]]"
Aeschylus ,Agamemnon,43             ,（Leader Of The Chorus）,"We shall soon know about this passing on of flaming lights and beacon signals and fires, whether they perhaps are true or whether, dream-like, this light's glad coming has beguiled our senses. Look! I see approaching from the shore a herald crowned with boughs of olive. The thirsty dust, consorting sister of the mud , assures me that neither by pantomime nor by kindling a flame of mountain wood will he signal with smoke of fire.

Aeschylus ,Agamemnon,46             ,Herald                ,"All hail, soil of  Argos , land of my fathers!  On this happy day in the tenth year I have come to you. Many hopes have shattered, one only have I seen fulfilled; for I never dared to dream that here in this land of  Argos  I should die and have due portion of burial most dear to me.  Now blessings on the land, blessings on the light of the sun, and blessed be Zeus, the land's Most High, and the Pythian lord; and may he launch no more his shafts against us.  Enough of your hostility did you display by Scamander's banks; but now, in other mood, be our preserver and our healer, O lord Apollo. And the gods gathered here, I greet them all; him, too, my own patron, Hermes, beloved herald, of heralds all revered; and the heroes who sped us forth, I pray that they may receive back in kindliness the remnant of the host which has escaped the spear. Hail, halls of our kings, beloved roofs, and you august seats, and you divinities that face the sun , if ever you did in days gone by, now after long lapse of years, with gladness in your eyes receive your king.  For bearing light in darkness to you and to all assembled here alike, he has returned—Agamemnon, our king.  Oh greet him well, as is right, since he has uprooted  Troy  with the mattock of Zeus the Avenger, with which her soil has been uptorn.  Demolished are the altars and the shrines of her gods; and the seed of her whole land has been wasted utterly.  Upon the neck of  Troy  he has cast such a yoke. Now he has come home, our king, Atreus' elder son, a man of happy fate, worthy of honor beyond all living men.  For neither Paris nor his partner city can boast that the deed was greater than the suffering.

Aeschylus ,Agamemnon,60             ,Herald                ,"Yes, all's well, well ended.  Yet, of what occurred in the long years, one might well say that part fell out happily, and part in turn amiss.  But who, unless he is a god, is free from suffering all his days? For were I to recount our hardships and our wretched quarters, the scanty space and the sorry berths——what did we not have to complain of . . .  Then again, ashore, there was still worse to loathe; for we had to lie down close to the enemy's walls, and the drizzling from the sky and the dews from the meadows distilled upon us, working constant destruction to our clothes and filling our hair with vermin. And if one were to tell of the wintry cold, past all enduring, when Ida's snow slew the birds; or of the heat, when upon his waveless noonday couch, windless the sea sank to sleep—but why should we bewail all this?  Our labor's past; past for the dead so that they will never care even to wake to life again. Why should we count the number of the slain, or why should the living feel pain at their past harsh fortunes? Our misfortunes should, in my opinion, bid us a long farewell.  For us, the remnant of the  Argive  host, the gain has the advantage and the loss does not bear down the scale; so that, as we speed over land and sea, it is fitting that we on this bright day make this boast: “The  Argive  army, having taken  Troy  at last, has nailed up these spoils to be a glory for the gods throughout  Hellas  in their shrines from days of old.” Whoever hears the story of these deeds must extol the city and the leaders of her host; and the grace of Zeus that brought them to accomplishment shall receive its due measure of gratitude.  There, you have heard all that I have to say."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,0.8175  ,positive       ,negative      ,sadness     ,Topic 6       ,0.5364999771118164 ,"[['may', 13.25], ['god', 12.32], ['son', 10.52], ['one', 10.25], ['man', 10.09], ['come', 9.71], ['father', 9.03], ['men', 8.57], ['must', 8.4], ['land', 7.85]]"

Aeschylus ,Agamemnon,63             ,Clytaemestra          ,"I raised a shout of triumph in my joy long before this, when the first flaming messenger arrived by night, telling that  Ilium  was captured and overthrown. Then there were some who chided me and said: “Are you so convinced by beacon-fires as to think that  Troy  has now been sacked?  Truly, it is just like a woman to be elated in heart.”  By such taunts I was made to seem as if my wits were wandering.  Nevertheless I still held on with my sacrifice, and throughout all the quarters of the city, according to their womanly custom, they raised a shout of happy praise while in the shrines of the gods they lulled to rest the fragrant spice-fed flame. So now why should you rehearse to me the account at length?  From the king himself I shall hear the whole tale; but I should hasten to welcome my honored husband best on his return. For what joy is sweeter in a woman's eyes than to unbar the gates for her husband when God has spared him to return from war? Give this message to my husband: let him come with all speed, his country's fond desire, come to find at home his wife faithful, even as he left her, a watchdog of his house, loyal to him, a foe to those who wish him ill; yes, for the rest, unchanged in every part; in all this length of time never having broken any seal.  Of pleasure from any other man or of scandalous repute I know no more than of dyeing bronze.stage  Exit"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,0.9941  ,positive       ,positive      ,joy         ,Topic 1       ,0.7560999989509583 ,"[['man', 15.42], ['father', 12.72], ['come', 10.84], ['one', 10.72], ['would', 10.5], ['god', 8.97], ['word', 8.61], ['let', 7.74], ['know', 7.45], ['may', 7.03]]"

Aeschylus ,Agamemnon,74             ,Herald                ,"An auspicious day one should not mar with a tale of misfortune—the honor due to the gods keeps them apart. When a messenger with gloomy countenance reports to a people dire disaster of its army's rout— one common wound inflicted on the State, while from many a home many a victim is devoted to death by the two-handled whip beloved of Ares, destruction double-armed, a gory pair—when, I say, he is packed with woes like this, he should sing the triumph-song of the Avenging Spirits. But when one comes with glad news of deliverance to a city rejoicing in its happiness—how shall I mix fair with foul in telling of the storm, not unprovoked by the gods' wrath, that broke upon the Achaeans? For fire and sea, beforehand bitterest of foes, swore alliance and as proof destroyed the unhappy  Argive  army.  In the night-time arose the mischief from the cruel swells.  Beneath blasts from  Thrace  ship dashed against ship; and they, gored violently by the furious hurricane and rush of pelting rain, were swept out of sight by the whirling gust of an evil shepherd. But when the radiant light of the sun rose we beheld the  Aegean  flowering with corpses of Achaean men and wreckage of ships. Ourselves, however, and our ship, its hull unshattered, some power, divine not human, preserved by stealth or intercession, laying hand upon its helm; and Savior Fortune chose to sit aboard our craft so that it should neither take in the swelling surf at anchorage nor drive upon a rock-bound coast.  Then, having escaped death upon the deep, in the clear bright day, scarce crediting our fortune, we brooded in anxious thought over our late mischance, our fleet distressed and sorely buffeted.  So now, if any of them still draw the breath of life, they speak of us as lost—and why should they not? We think the same of them.  But may all turn out for the best!  For Menelaus, indeed; first and foremost expect him to return. At least if some beam of the sun finds him alive and well, by the design of Zeus, who has not yet decided utterly to destroy the race, there is some hope that he will come home again. Hearing so much, be assured that you hear the truth.stage  Exit"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,-0.9636 ,negative       ,negative      ,joy         ,Topic 6       ,0.3937999904155731 ,"[['may', 13.25], ['god', 12.32], ['son', 10.52], ['one', 10.25], ['man', 10.09], ['come', 9.71], ['father', 9.03], ['men', 8.57], ['must', 8.4], ['land', 7.85]]"

And after her a goodly host of warrior huntsmen followed on the oars' vanished track in pursuit of a quarry that had beached its boat on Simois' leafy banks—in a strife to end in blood."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ,-0.9211 ,negative       ,negative      ,fear        ,Topic 5       ,0.3596999943256378 ,"[['know', 16.36], ['say', 14.8], ['tell', 13.08], ['speak', 9.95], ['ah', 9.1], ['see', 8.46], ['man', 8.29], ['come', 7.5], ['thing', 6.63], ['yes', 5.83]]"

But Priam's city has learned, in her old age, an altered strain, and now, I trust, wails a loud song, full of lamentation, calling Paris “evil-wed”; for she has born the burden of a life in which everything was destroyed, a life full of lamentation because of the wretched slaughter of her sons"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              ,-0.4215 ,negative       ,positive      ,sadness     ,Topic 1       ,0.5303999781608582 ,"[['man', 15.42], ['father', 12.72], ['come', 10.84], ['one', 10.72], ['would', 10.5], ['god', 8.97], ['word', 8.61], ['let', 7.74], ['know', 7.45], ['may', 7.03]]"

It is the evil deed that afterwards begets more iniquity like its own breed; but when a house is righteous, the lot of its children is blessed always."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,0.7913  ,positive       ,positive      ,sadness     ,Topic 6       ,0.7534000277519226 ,"[['may', 13.25], ['god', 12.32], ['son', 10.52], ['one', 10.25], ['man', 10.09], ['come', 9.71], ['father', 9.03], ['men', 8.57], ['must', 8.4], ['land', 7.85]]"

How shall I greet you?  How shall I do you homage, not overshooting or running short of the due measure of courtesy?  Many of mortal men put appearance before truth and thereby transgress the right. Every one is ready to heave a sigh over the unfortunate, but no sting of true sorrow reaches the heart; and in seeming sympathy they join in others' joy, forcing their faces into smiles. But whoever is a discerning shepherd of his flock cannot be deceived by men's eyes which, while they feign loyalty of heart, only fawn upon him with watery affection.  Now in the past, when you marshaled the army in Helen's cause, you were depicted in my eyes （for I will not hide it from you） most ungracefully and as not rightly guiding the helm of your mind in seeking through your sacrifices to bring courage to dying men.

Aeschylus ,Agamemnon,84             ,Agamemnon             ,"  Argos  first, as is right and proper, I greet, and her local gods who have helped me to my safe return and to the justice I exacted from Priam's town.  For listening to no pleadings by word of mouth,  a shield-armed folk, that launched its leap when the Pleiades waned.  Vaulting over its towered walls, the ravening lion lapped up his fill of princely blood. For the gods then I have stretched out this prelude. But, touching your sentiments—which I heard and still bear in memory—I both agree and you have in me an advocate.  For few there are among men in whom it is inborn to admire without envy a friend's good fortune.  For the venom of malevolence settles upon the heart and doubles the burden of him who suffers from that plague:  he is himself weighed down by his own calamity, and groans to see another's prosperity. From knowledge—for well I know the mirror of companionship—I may call a shadow of a shade those who feigned exceeding loyalty to me. Only Odysseus, the very man who sailed against his will, once harnessed, proved my zealous yoke-fellow.  This I affirm of him whether he is alive or dead. But, for the rest, in what concerns the State and public worship, we shall appoint open debates and consider.  Where all goes well, we must take counsel so that it may long endure; but whenever there is need of healing remedy, we will by kind appliance of cautery or the knife endeavor to avert the mischief of the disease. And now I will pass to my palace halls and to my household hearth, and first of all pay greeting to the gods.  They who sent me forth have brought me home again.  May victory, now that it has attended me, remain ever with me constant to the end!stage  He descends from his chariot; enter Clytaemestra, attended by maidservants carrying purple tapestries"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                ,0.8656  ,positive       ,positive      ,fear        ,Topic 6       ,0.5910000205039978 ,"[['may', 13.25], ['god', 12.32], ['son', 10.52], ['one', 10.25], ['man', 10.09], ['come', 9.71], ['father', 9.03], ['men', 8.57], ['must', 8.4], ['land', 7.85]]"
Aeschylus ,Agamemnon,85             ,Clytaemestra          ," Citizens of  Argos , you Elders present here, I shall not be ashamed to confess in your presence my fondness for my husband—with time diffidence dies away in humans. Untaught by others, I can tell of my own weary life all the long while my husband was beneath  Ilium 's walls.  First and foremost, it is a terrible evil for a wife to sit forlorn at home, severed from her husband, always hearing many malignant rumors, and for one messenger after another to come bearing tidings of disaster, each worse than the last, and cry them to the household. And as for wounds, had my husband received so many as rumor kept pouring into the house, no net would have been pierced so full of holes as he.  Or if he had died as often as reports claimed, then truly he might have had three bodies, a second Geryon, and have boasted of having taken on him a triple cloak of earth [ample that above, of that below I speak not], one death for each different shape.  Because of such malignant tales as these, many times others have had to loose the high-hung halter from my neck, held in its strong grip.  It is for this reason, in fact, that our boy, Orestes, does not stand here beside me, as he should—he in whom rest the pledges of my love and yours.  Nor should you think this strange. For he is in the protecting care of our well-intentioned ally, Strophius of Phocis, who warned me of trouble on two scores—your own peril beneath  Ilium 's walls, and then the chance that the people in clamorous revolt might overturn the Council, as it is natural for men to trample all the more upon the fallen.  Truly such an excuse supports no guile.  As for myself, the welling fountains of my tears are utterly dried up—not a drop remains. In night-long vigils my eyes are sore with weeping for the beacon-lights set for you but always neglected. The faint whir of the buzzing gnat often waked me from dreams in which I beheld more disasters to you than the time of sleep could have compassed.  But now, having born all this, my heart freed from its anxiety, I would hail my husband here as the watchdog of the fold, the savior forestay of the ship, firm-based pillar of the lofty roof, only-begotten son of a father, or land glimpsed by men at sea beyond their hope, dawn most fair to look upon after storm, the gushing stream to thirsty wayfarer—sweet is it to escape all stress of need.  Such truly are the greetings of which I deem him worthy.  But let envy be far removed, since many were the ills we endured before. And now, I pray you, my dear lord, dismount from your car, but do not set on common earth the foot, my King, that has trampled upon  Ilium .stage  To her attendants Why this loitering, women, to whom I have assigned the task to strew with tapestries the place where he shall go? Quick!  With purple let his path be strewn, that Justice may usher him into a home he never hoped to see.  The rest my unslumbering vigilance shall order duly, if it please god, even as is ordained.",0.9174  ,positive       ,positive      ,fear        ,Topic 2       ,0.3382999897003174 ,"[['one', 15.19], ['ship', 12.26], ['child', 11.74], ['came', 9.95], ['odysseus', 9.18], ['head', 9.08], ['son', 9.08], ['sea', 8.28], ['horse', 7.64], ['ajax', 7.62]]"
Aeschylus ,Agamemnon,87             ,Agamemnon             ,"Offspring of Leda, guardian of my house, your speech fits well with my absence; for you have drawn it out to ample length.  But becoming praise—this prize should rightly proceed from other lips.  For the rest, pamper me not as if I were a woman, nor, like some barbarian,  grovel before me with widemouthed acclaim; and do not draw down envy upon my path by strewing it with tapestries.  It is the gods we must honor thus; but it is not possible for a mortal to tread upon embroidered fineries without fear. I tell you to revere me not as a god, but as a man.  Footmats and embroideries sound diverse in the voice of Rumor; to think no folly is the best gift of the gods.
